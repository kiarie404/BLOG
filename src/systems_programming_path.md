# Systems Programming Learning Path

#### PHASE 1 : WASM + Rust
- [x] Learn Wasm itself by reading the Official specs and the book by Kevin Hoffman.
- [ ] Use wasm in a no-std environment. Preferably on a Rasp-Berry pi. Document that sh*.
- [ ] Write a small wasm runtime
- [ ] Contribute to embedded-wasm projects... make some friends along the way. [AeroRust][Rust Community Kenya][others...] 

#### PHASE 2 : 
- [ ] Implement and Document Hobo OS
- [ ] Integrate Hobo OS into Tock
- [ ] Mathematially acertain the Kernel's purity

#### PHASE 3 :
- [ ] Learn IoT stuff : implement a project based on the Rust stack
- [ ] Concentrate on Embedded Rust and the Riscv ISA
- [ ] Implement a copy of the BILL-E project

#### PHASE 4 :
- [ ] Concentrate more on material Science & nano-robotics
