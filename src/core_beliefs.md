## Reason for Journal   
Mirin Brah?!  

The main purpose of this journal is to give fellow sick c*nts a fighting chance.<br>


I hope you grow strong and become an exceptional engineer.  


Life is this endless ocean; everybody drowns in the end.    
We were forced into this ocean by child_bearers.  
We have no choice but to swim or drown.  
We are too afraid to die, so we swim and swim and swim.  
We try to give meaning to our swimming.  
Some succeed in doing so, others don't.  
But what I don't understand is why someone would go ahead and bring another human to this ocean.  


Well, if we have to fight, then it's better to fight for the unborn.    
And save them from child_bearers.  
I hope whoever reads this grows up to be a strong engineer.  
Strong enough to either...  

Give humanity an island, where they are not forced to always swim.  
Or  
Give humanity a global and instant painless death, so that no-one has to ever suffer. This way, no-one ever gets to realise that people died and feel bad about it.
