# Why go absolute Open Source? 
### (The GreyBeard version kind of OpenSource)

**Main reason :**  
Altruism. Brotherhood.   

OSS Gives fellow upcoming nerds an idea to hold on to.  
It gives fellow upcoming nerds hope that there are men before them who share similar beliefs.  
And that those men are as strong as they get, iregardless of the economic nature of open-sourcing ideas.   


Every nerd in existence understands that there is at least one period in their lives when ideas were what kept their lives bearable. Struggling with existensialism? Hey, here are men out there who are fighting the same battle... hey look, they are deliberitely sacrificing a lot so you can have an easier time! 

Altruism motivates altruism. Yes, OSSers may be explioted... but I would allow myself to be exploited if i knew my ideas would give hope to a future stronger man. It would give hope to a boy who is in a somehow similar position as I was.   


**Logical reasons I can use as a cover-up my main reason**  
Google them, they are many.
