# Magic  

Tech is our magic. In this book we will cover two kinds of magic spells : ***Computation*** and ***Material science***.
Our magic-mastery will help us control our fate in the universe.  


In our path to becoming wizards, we need to be able to control actual matter/atoms, that is why we will learn material science. We will try to make materials that suit our needs... programmable materials.  

Computation spells will help us abstract and control programmable materials. Our software will mostly contain the following technologies :
1. Rust - Rust helps you write safe, performant, well-thought out software. The tooling and documentation is great. Rust looks like a language that will last the test of time. You can write both high-level and low-level code with it. It is a language worth sticking to.   


2. Wasm and WASI - Wasm is a technology that helps you write 'kinda' portable software...the holy-grail of distributing software. I believe that almost all future software across the net will be packaged as wasm modules. I am more interested in bringing wasm to the IoT sector because programmable matter would be implemented as some kind of IoT.<br> Moreover, wasm comes with capability-based security as its default... a necessity of any software at this point.   
WASI is a standard API for anything... let's stop this trend of using custom APIs... embrace inclusive APIs such as WASI.  


1. Riscv - riscv is an open ISA. For humanity to move from zero-to-one at a faster pace, altruism has to be embraced. Let's trash proprietary software wherever possible. Can we all just agree, proprietary-anything is cringe at this point? We have bigger demons to slay...let's share ideas in a non-exploitive way. Open standards have a better chance in lasting the test of time.

2. Embedded Oses and Runtimes- programmable matter will be controlled using some kind of Operating System. This is why we will learn about Embedded OSes like Tock. We will also learn of wasm-runtimes in no-std environments.

3. AGI - I don't know about this...yet. AGI might help in the the design and implementation of the meta-materials and structures that we will make. It will help in knowledge discovery too. The AGI must be able to explain itself... no blackboxes. 

## Disclaimer:  
I am currently learning Computational Spells. I have not yet reached a level where I can write about Material Science Spells.   



Yea, I sound like a corny-know-it-all who is suffering from the necessary Dunning-Kruger effect.  
But to become a Chad, you have to be a corny cringe kid first.  
Why should you be ashamed of being stupid?
