For a long time, I have tried to use CSS. Each time I mess around with it, I find a constant and clear closure : "HTML, CSS and me are 100% incompatible". Too much work. Too annoying.  
Web development UI creation is something I would never do even if my life depended on it. 

For this reason. I will read up on egui and concentrate on ML and Embedded Systems. Venture out into IoT whole heartedly.  
At least my heart finds satisfaction in these things. One heart, finally.  

I really hope egui becomes my tool of choice. Please.
