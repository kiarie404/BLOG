# Intro_to_nanoscale_physics


let's abandon classic mechanical physics... and embrace new guesses about the world.    


"Whereas classical mechanics is deterministic—one action equaling a reaction—the tools of quantum mechanics are probability and statistics, and educated guesses"  --> Am I f*cked here?    



These two mechanics do not clash. They complement each other, explaining phenomena from different perspectives. They are not in clash with each other.  
"if you wish to understand the physics of a basketball, you can use classical mechanics, a buckyball, and quantum mechanics."   

**What is measurement?**    
This is the act of trying to determine the value of a property associated with a certain small particle/wave.   
The value could be its : energy level, position, momentum, 
The term "measurement" is a misnomer. Measurement in the quantum world affects the thing being measured. It interferes... This is NOT  'measurement', this is 'interfering with something so as to confirm something about it'  


**what might make you think "yes, this thing is a wave and this other one is a particle**   
particle-like behaviour include :
- you can pip-point its exact location at a moment
- You can predict its trajectory when in motion
- They do not exhibit inteference patterns (construcive or destructive patterns)
- There is no quantization of states... they follow classical mechanics when it comes to change of energy.  

Wave like behaviour include :   
- They exhibit iterference patterns
- Superposition: (explained later).
- Diffraction: If the object exhibits diffraction patterns, bending around obstacles, it is behaving more like a wave. Diffraction is a phenomenon characteristic of waves.
- Quantization of States: If the object's energy levels are quantized (occur in discrete levels), it is more likely to be exhibiting wave-like behavior. This is often observed in quantum systems.

**Superposition**   
Particles change state fast. Like a spinning coin, it is neither heads nor tails... because it is spinning and changing states fast.    
Particles are also fluid, they may exhibit multiple states at the same time... in different ratios.  
So there you go, superposition means that either something is switching states very fast or is in different ratios at the same time.    

**Problem with measurement**    
Maybe one day we can find a non-invasive way of measuring particle values.  

**Orbit != Orbital**    
An orbit is a ring.  
An orbital is a cloud... sometimes 3d, 2d, shapeless, shapeful.... it is a cloud.   

The diameter of an electron is roughly 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a proton.




**"What are EM waves? Let us start with what they are not. They are not mechanical waves
like sound waves, water waves, or waves traveling down a rope. EM waves can move not only
through air and water, but also through the vacuum of space—something mechanical waves
cannot do. No matter what their frequency, f, is, EM waves always travel through empty space
at 299,792,458 m/s. (This is the speed of light, c; or, to be truly accurate, “the speed of elec-
tromagnetic radiation in a vacuum.”) " 


so what are EM waves? what are they made of?
If they are made o something... how are they able to move in a vacuum? Doesn't that mean that that place is no longer a vacuum? 
What does water waves have to do with a vacuum? Having water waves in a place immediately makes that space to cease being a vacuum.
What is electromagnetic radiation?
How was its speed measured? Is that possible? or is it a guess?**
