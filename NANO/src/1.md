- Scanning tunneling microscope? scanning probe microscopes?
- What other kinds of scanners exist?
- What other kinds of manipulators exist?


- Four fundamental forces? -- then I really need to understand these 4 fundamental forces.  

- I would love to build a molecular assembler
- What is nuclear technology?


- How about a cloning business?
- How about assured food

- I want to build software that helps me create anything.  

- Safety is important. But don't be a coward, that is down-right disgusting.    


### Short notes
- Avogadro’s number is 6.02 × 10 23 . It is defined as the number of carbon-12 atoms in exactly 12 g. James, can you guess why?
- Safety {track each particle, maybe record, find a way to dispose any partcile}
- Are all reactions precedented... are there any side-effects to humans? is any of your nano particles dangerous in certain conditions? We do not want another DDT insecticide.  
- Check out the safety questions in chapter 1 of the book... F* answer them.
- our current and future problems with nanomaterial toxicity arise from a shortage of information.
