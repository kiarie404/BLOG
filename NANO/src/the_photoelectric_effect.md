## the_photoelectric_effect

the energy of a photon is calculated as     
    E of photon = hf where h is the planks constant and f is the frequency of the EM wave.      


For a photon to remove an electron from the surface of metal, that photon needs to have more energy than the energy restraining the electron to the metal.  

Then the removed electron flies off with the kinetic of ....  hf − φ where φ is the energy used to restrain electrons to the metal and hf if the energy of the oncoming electron    


the cutoff frequency, fc , is the frequency at which the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons goes to zero.  
fc = φ/h    


The sun ladies and gentlemen : 4H protons → He + 2 neutrinos + 6 photons    
Every second, approximately 700 million metric tons of the Sun’s hydrogen becomes helium through fusion. The Sun sheds about 5 × 10 6 metric tons of mass per second in the form of energy. Some of this energy fuels the Sun’s endless fusion reactions and some of it is emitted into space as EM radiation. The Sun emits EM radiation in all parts of the spectrum.         


Neutrinos are tiny, elusive particles that travel at the speed of light and lack electric charge. Very little is known about them   



## Wave particle Duality    

A particle is something that has a definite position. Somthing you can put on the co-ordinate system of the universe.   
A wave is something that does not have a definite position... but you can see where it is causing effect. It is something affecting many things at once.    

When something behaves as both a wave and a particle, this constitutes wave–particle duality. Photons and electrons show wave-particle duality. 

From the split experiments, it is seen that electrons arrive as wholes just like bullets. They also interfere with each other just like the water waves.    


## The uncertainity principle   
In one experiment we were observing electrons by shedding light in the path that they were taking. This made them to stop behaving like a wave and instead behave like a particle.  

In 1927, Werner Heisenberg decided that it was not sloppiness, improper experimental procedures, or inadequate equipment that was making it so difficult to watch the electrons without disturbing them. It was the way of nature, now known as the uncertainty principle.  

"The more precisely something’s position is determined, the less precisely its momentum is known." This is because we hit the electron with a photon that had momentum, which consequently caused the electron whose position we were trying to find to change its momentum.    

To measure something, you have to interact with it. But maybe one day I will find a way that does not interfere with the electrons.
