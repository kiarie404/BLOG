- Mathematical notations are noise. They are confusing. Explain the concept without the greek letters please. Use variables...use words... use diagrams. It will save a lot of time when trying to understand concepts. It is easy to lie to yourself when using math. Maths lies, it is detached from reality. Assumptions above assuptions. Implications above implications.  

- James, when you re-write physics, don't just throw in formulas and words that you do not understand. Just like in programming, call functions that you KNOW... not functions that you think you know. Take time to understand the pparameters, the effects it has on accepted input, the return value. Everything about it.   

- levels
    - classic mechanics
    - special relativity (mechanics of things at very high speed)
    - quantum mechanics (mechanics of very small things)
    - Quantum field theory (mechanics of small and fast things)

- "Elementary particles are usually small and fast..." - why are they fast? What made them fast? Can I make them slow?  
- Do I need to learn relativity and Quantum mechanics in order to understand Quantum field theory? 


- "in relativity, energy and momentum are always conserved, But rest-mass is not preserved. So a decay of particle A may result in particles B and C where the combined weight of both B and C is less than the weight of A". - I do not know why mass is not preserved. I do not know why energy and momentum is preserved. 

Photons are massless? What the hell?    

What are ElectroMagnetic waves? How are they formed?  

How are we able to see with our eyes? Why can we see only some waves of certain frequencies?    

What is a sound wave? What is a water wave? How are they diferent from the EM wave?  

What is "frequency" of a wave? I can stop pretending that I understand what frequency is and why it is important. Forget the math, what is the relevance of frequency? Wavelength? Amplitude?  

How did people know the speed of light? How are people so sure about it?    (the speed of electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum.)   

All these math formulas... How did they come to be? They are so un-intuitive... I prefer small programs over math formulas. Math formulas suck BIG time.    


I need to understand electricity and magnetism. They are being referenced everywhere  


Why the discrete quantum values? Why not continuous change in the level of energy?  


"E = nhf" - "Here, n is a positive integer (never a fraction) called a quantum number, and f is the frequency at which the atom vibrates. The h in the equation is a universally important constant named after Planck himself"  --> I dont get how this formula came to be     



"Planck’s work suggested that if atoms gain and lose energy in this quantized way, there must be specialized packets of energy floating around—a universal currency of energy exchange. And there is. It is the photon. Atoms emit or absorb photons when they hop up
or down between quantum states."

James, quick question - what is energy  

What is the planks constant? Why is it important? Why is it accepted? What make it true? How did plank pull it off?     


What is mass? Like really, what is mass?    
What is momentum?   
Why the fuck does a photon have zero mass? And if it has no mass, how does it have momentum? - check BACK-OF-THE-ENVELOPE 3.5 in the nanotechnology book.   


"objects emit thermal radiation over a continuous spectrum of frequencies. There is an exception, however. Gases, when excited by electricity or heat, can give off multiple, single-frequency bands of radiation instead of a continuous spectrum."  --> Why? Kwani gases are special?
