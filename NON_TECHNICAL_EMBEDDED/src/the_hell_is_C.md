# The hell is C?
#### 12/09/2023

Rust Language is the language that made me think that I can write code to control an entire solar system.  
I initially knew that complex low-level software had to be written in complex C, an art reserved for dark mages only.    
Rust inspired me to be a mage.  


Rust documentation taught me how to handle errors, test code, measure performance, modularize code... it changed everything for me... mentally, emotionally.  
C and C++ contributed greately in my early development. But Rust lang, the docs, the crate-community changed my attitude towards complex software development.  


C was my first language. C is neat. C is important. C is everywhere. Mastering C as an embedded dev makes 100% sense. C is god-language.   
But C does not hit close to my heart as Rust does.  

**I therefore choose to be deluded, and concentrate on using Rust as my primary language.  
I will treat C as a language that I use only when I have to. Or when working with other devs who prefer C.**    



And anyway, it is better to scratch an itch instead of blindly doing what is expected. Tech is not static.
