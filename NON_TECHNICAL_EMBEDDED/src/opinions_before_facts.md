# opinions_before_facts

This are my bias opinions about the embedded tech in Kenya. I am speaking from a complete naive point of view, I have never left the house... so I am speaking from 100% romours (in fact they are not even romour-based, they are just thoughts out of no-where).  

1. Tech mostly involves the agriculture sector and financial sector
2. The Industrial IoT is not done in Kenya, but maintenance gets done by Kenyans
3. IoT in millitary is not advanced (like Anduril)
4. Medical IoT is done by foreign companies
5. C and python reign. 
6. Devs don't really develop their own hardware
7. Devs don't really write their own drivers/kernels
8. Devs don't really create dev-tools. They depend on already made tools



I am aware that I have a very low chance of getting employed in Kenya as an embedded engineer.  
I am aware that IoT in Kenya is immature.   

But this means I have the opportunity to start a new with less competition. It means we can start with better tools and languages like Tock and Rust.  
If I look at it from the perspective of employment, it is completely hopeless. If I look at it from the perspective of a maker, it is a free market... and you get to be pioneers. I mea most of my friends have done microprocessor course and computer Science. We can totally do this
