# Ideas

I think Kenya will become an awesome tech hub if we concentrate on generating new ideas.    
Not finance ideas.  
Not distribution ideas.  
Not ideas that have already been implemeted abroad.  

I mean NEW ideas.   
Hardware ideas, physical engineering ideas, biology ideas... hardcore science.... Ideas that are new even to the outside world.  
Now that would be interesting. But new ideas are really hard to come up with.   



Coming up with ideas is hard.   
It is very expensive to dedicate time to think.  
It is hard to think of abstract ideas if you are on survival mode(poor).    



The urge to go remote in some coutry-side where the rent is like 1000 bob. Hide and cocentrate on finding new ideas.    
It does not matter whether you come up with a new idea or not... just go think.
