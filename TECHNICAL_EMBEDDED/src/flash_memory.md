# Flash Memory

**Flash memory** is a non-volatile semiconductor memory technology that is widely used for data storage in a variety of electronic devices, from USB drives and memory cards to smartphones, tablets, solid-state drives (SSDs), and embedded systems. Flash memory is known for its ability to retain data even when power is removed, making it suitable for both storage and data transfer applications. 

**NAND and NOR Flash**: There are two primary types of flash memory: NAND flash and NOR flash. NAND flash is used for data storage in devices like SSDs and USB drives due to its higher density and cost-effectiveness. NOR flash is used for code storage and booting in devices like embedded systems and microcontrollers because of its faster read times.


**Erase Blocks**: Flash memory is organized into erase blocks, which are the smallest units that can be erased and reprogrammed. Erasing and writing data to a flash memory cell involves changing its electrical charge

**Cell Types**: Flash memory comes in various cell types, with the two most common being Single-Level Cell (SLC) and Multi-Level Cell (MLC). SLC stores one bit of data per cell, providing high speed and durability but at a higher cost. MLC stores multiple bits per cell, making it cost-effective but with slightly lower performance and endurance.
