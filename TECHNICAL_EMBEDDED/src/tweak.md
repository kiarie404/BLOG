Components  
- deliver Rust Runtime 
- improve Rust developer experience on Ubuntu
- Provide necessary tooling to Rust developers (all industrial domains included)
- Opensource environment for linux and Rust+tools
- packaging software for Debian and Ubuntu
- Rust experience, ideally in the world of cloud-native software and Linux

Attributes ;    
- Passionate and understanding of Opensource Software
- Passionate and Understands Linux systems
- Passionate and Understands software architectures and Rust programming language

Aim :   
make Ubuntu the best operating system to develop and run Rust applications in the cloud, in datacenters, in containers, directly on the operating system, and anywhere Ubuntu can run.
    * what are the Ubuntu products?
    * Where can Ubuntu run?
    * Where do Rustaceans have problems when creating,deploying and maintainig Rust Applications? Which kind of applications to be specific?

All this is to be done in a secure, reliable, performing, efficient and future-proof fashion. So how is your solution all of the above?


Facts worth knowing :   
- The [Ubuntu Foundations Team](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FoundationsTeam) delivers the core Ubuntu system, the base for the entire Ubuntu family of products and services.


Expected:   
- Select, integrate and package best-of-breed tooling with Ubuntu to improve developer and operator experience with Rust
-  create new features
-  *** I am not a longtime linux user
-  You have experience or are interested in learning how to package software for Debian and Ubuntu



Tasks :
- Know about canonical products, where does it run on? How has/does it get developed?
- add products as skills
- RustRuntime in many environments (touched and untouched by Ubuntu)
