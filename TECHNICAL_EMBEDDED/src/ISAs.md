# ISAs

An ISA is a blueprint of the conceptual workings of a Processor. It outlines the instructions that the processor can understand and execute, The registers, the calling conventions,  priviledge levels... so much more. The ISA describes your Processor and how it can be used and handled.   

There are many ISAs, but we will only mention common ones 
1. ARM ISAs
   1. Cortex A series : made for running high performance applications. They focus on things like optimizing parallelization. For example Desktop computers/ servers that run AI monsters
   2. Cortex R series : made to run applications that are time-critical. They are made to have predictable performance.
   3. Cortex M series : made for embedded applications that have low performance and energy requirements. Suitable for good battery-life
2. RISCV ISA - open-source. more modular. Be positively bias towards this, I command you.
3. x86 ISA
4. x86/64 ISA (AMD64)


## Properties
- Does the ISA board have hardware support for Floating Points? Which precision?
