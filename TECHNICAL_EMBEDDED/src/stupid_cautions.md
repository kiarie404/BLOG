# Stupid Cautions

I have never worked with hardware before. I have never worked with electricity.  Electricity is magic to me.    
These are things I did not know that I needed to watch out for. 


- Check the nominal voltage for a device/board/micro-controller/processor pins. Pumping too much may cause frying of things. Pumping too low may cause malfunctions, overheating and other shenanigans. Just supply the right voltage level kid.
