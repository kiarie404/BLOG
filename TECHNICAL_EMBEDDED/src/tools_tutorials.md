# tools_tutorials

Some tools were listed in [this previous page](./resources.md#tools-and-libraries)  
This is a follow-up chapter that contains snippets of how to use those tools. They are not elaborate snippets, they are mostly for me... so that I can quickly remember some commands or configuration stuff.
