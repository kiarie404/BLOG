# Performance

Assumption is that the required functionalities have been met.  
performance metrics :
1. Code Execution speed
2. memory usage
3. Development time (compilation, collaboration, deployment )


### Profiling
This is the act of analysing the current performance metrics of the program. ie Analysing it and giving the current perfomance results.  
Some performance profiling results include :
1. Execution Time
2. Resource Usage results (CPU, power, Memory, Network bandwidth)
3. Number of requests (eg database queries)
4. Function-level analysis results eg Which funtions get called more?, at which frequency? which function uses more resources? Which function calls are unnecessary in certain flows? Which functions can be ommited safely?  
5. Compilation time

### Benchmarking

[source](https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/benchmarking.html)

This is the act of : 
1. Profiling programs that do the same thing (or close to the same thing)
2. Comparing the profiling results (ie. benchmarking)
