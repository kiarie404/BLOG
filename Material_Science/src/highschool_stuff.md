There are many theories about what an atom really is.  
One school of thought says that an atom is a unit that is made up of {protons, neutrons and electrons}.  

Keep in mind that this is just one school of thought... we will stick with this for now... I have no idea what the other schools of thought think.  

| Atom component | Charge  | Energy in Coulombs | mass in Kg    |
|----------------|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| Proton         | +       | 1.602 × (10^19) C  | 1.67 x 10^-27 |
| Neutron        | Neutral | 1.602 × (10^19) C  | 1.67 x 10^-27 |
| Electron       | -       | 1.602 × (10^19) C  | 9.11 x 10^-31 |
|                |         |                    |               |



**The Atomic Mass** of the atom is given by adding the mass of the Protons and the Neutrons. People just decided not to add the mass of electrons because people think their weight is negligible... but I dont know shit... I think we should add it....

The number of protons in an element is constant. There are some elements that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. These kinds of atoms are called **isotopes**. Due to this imbalance of the number of protons and neutrons, isotopes end up having different atomic masses.    

**Weighted Average Atomic mass**. Isotopes exist in different ratios. When you meet a situation where the isotopes are in different ratios... you can decide to perform a weighted mass average. You have your own reasons of doing so... but I see this as a self-inflicted inaccuracy.    

Just like how humans cannot peacefully agree on one way of measuring things, scientist chose two ways of measuring mass of atoms.  

1. Using **Atomic Mass Units (amu)**.   
    Where 1 amu == (1/12 * mass of carbon-12) == (1/12 * (24 * 1.67 * (10^-27))) Kg. This also means that the Carbon-12 atom has a mass of 12 amu. The hydrogen atom has a mass of 1 amu, The Iron(Fe 26) atom has a mass of 26 amu.  

    How the F* did I get 26 for the Iron atom?  
    1 amu = (1/12 * (24 * 1.67 * (10^-27))) Kg == 3.34 * (10^-27) Kg

    The raw mass of a Fe26 atom = 52 * 1.67 * (10^-27) Kg
    Which means that (mass of fe)/(mass of 1amu) = 26 amu

2. Using raw grams and Kgs


In one **mole** of a substance, there are **6.022 × 10 23 (Avogadro’s number)** components.     



There is this equation that I am currently unable to understand... but I just use it anyway... what could go wrong?  
> 1 amu/atom (or molecule) = 1 g/mol
