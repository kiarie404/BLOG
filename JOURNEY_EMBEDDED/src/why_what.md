# Why? What?

This is a record of my journey of becoming an Embedded Systems Engineer.    
I hope that other young mages who also want to become Embedded System Engineers will find this book awesome.  
Find inspiration, see the pitfalls, see the delusions.  

Becoming an Embedded guy is like becoming a mage. You control hardware, physical matter. That is why the title has the word 'incantations'.  
Experienced mage do not need to use chants when casting spells... hence the name "chantless Icantations". This is a journal about becoming a chantless mage.   







Also, I'm just giving myself mental clarity by journaling.
